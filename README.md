# Backpropagation

A neural network made from scratch with Python3 ‚ù§Ô∏è üêç.‚ù§Ô∏è

## Running commands

The command line to execute this neural network is:

```sh
/$ python3 main.py network.txt initial_weights.txt dataset.txt
```

Where `network.txt` is a file which content determines the topology (number
or neurons and layers) of the network, the first line denotes the value
of the regularization parameter (`Œª`). The example above defines a
neural network with Œª = 0.25 and 3 layers, containing 2, 3 and 1 neurons
respectively, excluding the bias neuron.

```txt
0.25
2
3
1
```

`initial_weights.txt`, as said by its name, gives the initial weights to
the layers. For the topology above, a valid file would look like the following:

```txt
0.4,0.1,0.5;0.3,0.2,0.4;0.1,0.25,0.7
0.7,0.5,0.6,0.26
```
